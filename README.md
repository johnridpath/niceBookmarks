# niceBookmarks
Dirty script to reformat Chrome's "export bookmarks"

1. Go to Chrome > Bookmarks > Bookmark Manager
2. Organise > Export Bookmarks to HTML file
3. Paste this code at the end of the HTML file (adjust as per formatting requirements
4. Open in browser

Yep, it's dirty. But so is `<!DOCTYPE NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1>`
